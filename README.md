# MoveFFLogErrorFiles
This project assists in finding corrupt meda files. It uses the ffmpeg utility to scan the file and then logs any errors found. Corrupt files can also be moved to a separate directory. 

I created this project when I reaslised a number or my ALAC files in my music library were corrupt resulting in unpleasant sounding glitches or small silences during playback. I attempted to fix this using Perfect Tunes, but in some cases Perfect Tunes was either unable to determine matching entries in its database, or simply missed the corrupted files, hence this utility
